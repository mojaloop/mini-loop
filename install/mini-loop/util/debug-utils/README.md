# mini-loop debug-utils
A mixture of scripts and utilities I (Tom Daly) use to debug kubernetes issues

## a vague outline of some of the things here
- apache-test: is  deployed with kustomize to test ingress functionality  
- mysql : shows how to connext to your mysql instance(s) running in the mini-loop k8s cluster
- calico : intial tests for implelemnting calico 
- rbac: some half-baked tests for playing with k8s RBAC
- helloworld:  
- dnsutils : I used for debugging / testing dns in the cluster 
- busybox.yaml : about as simple as it gets to enable shell access into a running pod.
