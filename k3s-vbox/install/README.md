# files supporting k3d mini-loop install of mojaloop
Most files here are adapted from Lewis Daly's OSS lab setup 
see https://github.com/vessels-tech/ml-oss-sandbox for more information

If the file name starts with "k3d" it indicates changes from the ml-oss-sandbox origin
but if it does not start with k3d then most likely it is simply copied here to enable
use in the mini-loop code.
